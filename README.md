Custom uix
======

This is a copy of the amazing kivymd library made by the kivymd team with some minor changes to suit my specific needs. 
99% of the code here is not written by me. I only made some changes to make the widgets behave like I need them to, like adding a logo in the toolbar and adding some custom colors to the palette.
